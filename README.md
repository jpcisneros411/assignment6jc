In this assignment we were tasked with buiding a weather app that would retrieve information using
the OpenWeather one call API and to store the information locally. This also had to be built in a
way that would run in the browser and would have dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

The OpenWeather One Call Api documentation is available at openweathermap.org where you can set up an account and get free access to an API key much like the one that is implemented in this project. 

From there several AJAX calls which initiate a "GET" request. After that the server responds and provides information that builds up the rest of the page using html and css constructors and jquery.
